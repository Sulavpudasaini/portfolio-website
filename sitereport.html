    <h1>Site Report</h1>

    <p>
        This website was developed as part of the CSY1063 Web Development module.
        The purpose of this portfolio is to demonstrate my understanding of basic
        web development concepts such as HTML structure, CSS styling, navigation,
        and responsive design.
    </p>

    <p>
        At the beginning of the module, I had little experience with web development.
        Learning HTML helped me understand how web pages are structured using elements
        such as headers, navigation bars, sections, and footers. CSS was challenging
        at first, especially when dealing with layout and spacing, but with practice,
        I became more confident.
    </p>

    <p>
        During development, I faced several challenges including broken links,
        small syntax errors, and layout issues. Debugging these problems taught me
        the importance of carefully checking code and using validation tools.
        Fixing mistakes helped me understand how HTML and CSS work together.
    </p>

    <p>
        The design of the website is kept simple and clean. I chose a neutral color
        scheme with blue highlights to create a professional look. The font was kept
        simple to improve readability. The navigation menu is consistent across all
        pages to improve user experience.
    </p>

    <p>
        This project helped me understand the full process of building a website,
        from planning and coding to testing and improving. Overall, this module has
        increased my confidence in web development and prepared me for more advanced
        topics in the future.
